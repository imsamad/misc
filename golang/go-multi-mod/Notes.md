### Init workspace

go work init ./hello
The go command produces a go.work file that looks like this:

```sh
go 1.18

use ./hello
```

The go work init command tells go to create a go.work file for a workspace containing the modules in the ./hello directory.

The use directive tells Go that the module in the hello directory should be main modules when doing a build.

The Go command includes all the modules in the workspace as main modules.

This allows us to refer to a package in the module, even outside the module. Running the go run command outside the module or the workspace would result in an error because the go command wouldnâ€™t know which modules to use.
