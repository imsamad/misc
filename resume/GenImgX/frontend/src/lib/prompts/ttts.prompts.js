            text: `New York (CNN)When Liana Barrientos was 23 years old, she got married in Westchester County, New York.
            A year later, she got married again in Westchester County, but to a different man and without divorcing her first husband.
            Only 18 days after that marriage, she got hitched yet again. Then, Barrientos declared "I do" five more times, sometimes only within two weeks of each other.
            In 2010, she married once more, this time in the Bronx. In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her "first and only" marriage.
            Barrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of "offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree," referring to her false statements on the
            2010 marriage license application, according to court documents.
            Prosecutors said the marriages were part of an immigration scam.
            On Friday, she pleaded not guilty at State Supreme Court in the Bronx, according to her attorney, Christopher Wright, who declined to comment further.
            After leaving court, Barrientos was arrested and charged with theft of service and criminal trespass for allegedly sneaking into the New York subway through an emergency exit, said Detective
            Annette Markowski, a police spokeswoman. In total, Barrientos has been married 10 times, with nine of her marriages occurring between 1999 and 2002.
            All occurred either in Westchester County, Long Island, New Jersey or the Bronx. She is believed to still be married to four men, and at one time, she was married to eight men at once, prosecutors say.
            Prosecutors said the immigration scam involved some of her husbands, who filed for permanent residence status shortly after the marriages.
            Any divorces happened only after such filings were approved. It was unclear whether any of the men will be prosecuted.
            The case was referred to the Bronx District Attorney's Office by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security's
            Investigation Division. Seven of the men are from so-called "red-flagged" countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Georgia, Pakistan and Mali.
            Her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, was deported in 2006 to his native Pakistan after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.
            If convicted, Barrientos faces up to four years in prison.  Her next court appearance is scheduled for May 18.

            text: "The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure to reach a height of 300 metres. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.",

            text: `Client: Hi there! I'm interested in your services for developing a mobile app for my business. Can you provide me with an estimate of the cost?

            Developer: Absolutely, I'd be happy to discuss pricing with you. Could you please provide me with some details about the app you have in mind?
            
            Client: Sure! I'm looking to create a mobile app that allows users to browse and purchase products from my online store. It should have a user-friendly interface, secure payment options, and integration with our existing inventory system.
            
            Developer: That sounds like a great project! To give you an accurate estimate, I'll need to know more about the specific features you want to include, as well as any design preferences you have.
            
            Client: Well, I definitely want the app to have a sleek and modern design, similar to other popular e-commerce apps. As for features, besides the basic browsing and purchasing capabilities, I'd like to include features such as personalized recommendations, wishlist functionality, and the ability for users to track their orders.
            
            Developer: Understood. Integrating those features will require some additional development work, but it's definitely feasible. Do you have any preferences regarding the platform for the app? For example, are you looking to develop it for iOS, Android, or both?
            
            Client: I'd like to target both iOS and Android users to reach a broader audience. How would that affect the cost?
            
            Developer: Developing for both platforms does add some complexity to the project since it involves writing code for two different operating systems. As a result, the cost will be higher compared to developing for just one platform. However, it also means that your app will be accessible to a wider range of users.
            
            Client: That makes sense. What about ongoing maintenance and support? Do you offer any packages for that?
            
            Developer: Yes, we do offer maintenance and support packages to ensure that your app remains functional and up-to-date after it's launched. The cost of these packages depends on factors such as the level of support you require and the size and complexity of your app.
            
            Client: I see. Could you provide me with a breakdown of the costs involved, including development, design, and ongoing maintenance?
            
            Developer: Of course. Let me put together a detailed proposal for you based on our discussion so far. This will outline the scope of the project, the timeline for development, and a breakdown of the costs involved.
            
            [After a short pause]
            
            Developer: I've put together a proposal that outlines the development process, including the features and design elements we discussed, as well as the estimated cost for each phase of the project. I've also included options for ongoing maintenance and support based on your needs.
            
            Client: Thank you! I'll review the proposal and get back to you with any questions or feedback I have. Overall, though, I'm impressed with your thoroughness and professionalism.
            
            Developer: It's my pleasure! I'm here to help you every step of the way and ensure that we deliver a high-quality app that meets your needs and exceeds your expectations. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
            
            Client: Sounds great! I'll be in touch soon. Thanks again for your help.
            
            Developer: You're welcome. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!`,

            text: `Once upon a time, there was a tortoise in a jungle who lived life on his own terms. He was quiet, polite and non-interfering. In the same town lived a hare who loved to talk about the very many awards he had won for always finishing first in a race. One day he came up to the tortoise and said, “Why don’t you learn to walk faster? If you do, we can race someday.” The tortoise only smiled at him and moved on. The hare was in a wicked mood. Every day, he would approach the tortoise at the same place and pass the same comment. One fine day, when the hare challenged him again, the tortoise replied, “Alright, I accept the challenge.” He looked around and saw the other jungle animals clapping their hands and cheering him on.
            A few days later, the race began! The entire jungle came to a standstill to see the result of this great challenge. When the race began, the hare overtook the tortoise within no time. His speed was remarkably high, making him cover a considerable distance on the track. When he looked back and saw how far behind he had left the tortoise, the hare decided to stop running and rest for a while. He lay down under a huge banyan tree on one side of the track. The lovely shade of the leaves sent him into a deep slumber. Meanwhile, the tortoise ran with his slow speed without giving up and stopping. As time passed, he gradually caught up with the hare, who was still sleeping. The tortoise crossed by him and continued moving towards the winning line. Slowly but surely, the tortoise reached the finish line and won the race. The entire town started clapping for the tortoise. The loud cheers woke up the hare from his deep sleep. He woke up, not realising what had happened. He rubbed his eyes and thought to himself, “Gosh, the tortoise must be still struggling.” The hare got up and dashed towards the winning post. When he got there, he saw that, to his surprise, the tortoise was wearing the victory crown and all the other animals were congratulating him. The tortoise saw the hare from a distance and smiled at him. The hare sat down, regretting the action that made him lose the race against the slowest animal of the jungle. `,
