Hi guys, as you all know myself is Abdus Samad.

I am here to give persentation on Memory Management in programming languages.

There are three types of MM mainly:

1. Automatic and Manual MM
2. Garbage collection
3. Ownership MM

To explain what is Automatic MM, lets see an example

```c
int main() {

}

void fun1() {
  int students_roll_numbers[100];
}

void fun2() {
  int students_marks[100];
}

void fun3() {
  int classes[100];
}
```
