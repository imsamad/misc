## Function

Set of instrunctions;

Statement vs Expression

Statement - When executed does not written any value

Expression - When executed return value

Function is set/series of statements optinally ending in an expression.

RUST IS A EXPREESION-BASED LANGUAGE.

Declaring variable and assign value to it is an expressin unlike c or other langauge

```cpp
int x,y,z;
x = y = z = 10;
// It would work because x = 6 is an expression, and return 6
```

```rust
let x;
let y = (x = 10);
// would not work
```

Expression example

- Function invocation
- Macro invocation
- Creating scope block using {}
- if is expression

```rust
let y = {
  let x = 10;
  x + 1 // it is an expression bcoz not ending with semi-colon
}
print!("{}", y)

$Output:
11
```
