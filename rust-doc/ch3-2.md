## Data type

Normal Primitive data types are

1. Integer
2. Floating numbers - f32 and f64

- default is f64 because modern CPU, both show same speed with same precision.

3. Boolean
4. Char

### Integer

#### Detail

- 8, 16, 32, 64, 128
- Signed and unsigned

- isize - Its size depends on arch bit-size.
- usize -

Primary usage is when u indexing collection.

#### Representation

-

#### Integer overflow

- In case of development mode, Rust throw panick error

- In prod/release binary perform two's complement wrapping.

Handling of overflow[need a bit depth]

#### Tuple

Way of grouping various type of values of differnt data types into a single compound type.

They are of fixed length once created, later on can not grow or shrink down in size.

Create by writing comma-seprated list within paranthesis.

Accessing methods

- Destructuring
- Index

### Unit Tuple

#### Array

- Collection of same type data elements.
- Their size are fixed contrary to vectors.
- Used when quantity of items to be shoved into array are known at compiling time.

```rust
let arr:[i8; 5] = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

```rust
let arr= [3; 5]
print!(arr)
[3,3,3,3,3]
```

- Index out of bound - in case we access array element at the index beyond the length of array.
