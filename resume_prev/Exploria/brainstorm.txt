COMPLETED: 

Destination section: mobile responsiveness, better image hover.

1. I changed the order of pricing section's selectors. Check if anything broke.

2. Fixed navbar.

3. The hero text should be clamped according to the viewport, such that it appears in the blue-water-part in each device.

4. The hero image doesn't occupy the complete screen and leaves a black patch towards the end of the screen.

5. Change the dimensions of the "Safety first approach" so that the resize-animation is better than the current one.

6. Real content for welcome section.

7. Button hover effects.

8. Destination section:
    => Text appears way too large. Fix using clamp.

10. In the price section the image is overflowing towards the border. 
The price title looks congested. Improve the surrounding spacing.

11. In the price section: while flipping the card a black circle shaped structure appears at the bottom left. 

13. Analyse and configure the margin top for each section

14. Opening a modal (with the effects similar to Slicicious) on clicking the "Schedule now" nav button.

15. Favicon
16. Hamburger navbar for mobile
17. Replicate the shadow effets of section title from linear.app

8. Destination section: 
    => Box shadow, linear gradient to the parent container
    => Text appears way too large. Fix using clamp.

9. Adding a linear gradient to destination and testimonial sections.
